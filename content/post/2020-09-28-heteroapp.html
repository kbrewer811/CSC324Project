<p>One way that biologists measure genetic diversity loss over time is heterozygosity loss. Heterozygosity is having different alleles at any given loci. For instance, at a given loci, Aa is demonstarting heterozygosity, while AA or aa would be demonstrating homozygosity. Having the two different alleles is a good indicator of genetic diversity, so we can look at what percentage of a particular population is demonstrating heterozygosity to determine that population’s genetic viability.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the equation that helps us predict this.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ H_t = \left(1 - \frac{1}{2 * N_e}\right)^t \]</span>
In this equation, <span class="math inline">\(H_t\)</span> is proportion of original heterozygosity remaining at time (<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>), which is essentially the number of breeding seasons. The variable <span class="math inline">\(N_e\)</span> is the effective population size, or the number of individuals that are actually contributing to the next generation genetically.</p>
<p>Ideally, this proportion will stay relatively high, but this is dependent on the amount of time and contributing individuals. Given a small population, the heterozygosity will drop fairly quickly. Given a large population, the heterozygosity will still fall, but much slower, which could allow for some form of intervention if needed.</p>
<p>I created a shiny app that runs this calculation for a user-provided effective population size (<span class="math inline">\(N_e\)</span>) and time (<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>).
