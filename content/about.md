title: About Me
---

My name is Kaitlyn Brewer. I will be gradutating form Georgetown College with a major in Environmental Science and a minor in Computer Science in May of 2021, with plans of attending gradutae school later. *I am still trying to figure out for what and where.* My academic interests are Ecological Succession, Invasive and Endangered Species, and Botany.
I am currently the President of Georgetown Sustainability Initiative (GSI) and in the Science Honors program at Georgetown College.

My interest in computer science and coding came after my academic advisor suggested that I try the introductory class, which I loved. I never saw myself in this sort of field, but I really enjoy it and it complements aspects of my major as well. 

Please take a look at my articles, some of which are about my personal projects. 

This website is still a work in progress. Eventually, I would like to:
* Add a specific page to view a list of projects
* Potential for viewers to comment on projects
