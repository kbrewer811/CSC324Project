title: About Me
---

My name is Kaitlyn Brewer. I will be graduating from Georgetown College in May 2021, with an Environmental Science major and Computer Science minor. I have plans to go to graduate school in the future, though I am not sure where or for what. My main academic interests are successional ecology, invasive and endangered species, and botany, but I have a more specific interest in freshwater, invasive mussels, such as [quagga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quagga_mussel) and [zebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_mussel) mussels. 

My interest in computer science and coding came after my academic advisor suggested that I take the introductory course, and I really enjoyed it. I never thought that I would be in this field, but I am very thankful that I ended up here.
