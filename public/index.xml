      <description>One way that biologists measure genetic diversity loss over time is heterozygosity loss. Heterozygosity is having different alleles at any given loci. For instance, at a given loci, Aa is demonstarting heterozygosity, while AA or aa would be demonstrating homozygosity. Having the two different alleles is a good indicator of genetic diversity, so we can look at what percentage of a particular population is demonstrating heterozygosity to determine that populationâ€™s genetic viability.</description>

      <description>My name is Kaitlyn Brewer. I will be gradutating form Georgetown College with a major in Environmental Science and a minor in Computer Science in May of 2021, with plans of attending gradutae school later. I am still trying to figure out for what and where. My academic interests are Ecological Succession, Invasive and Endangered Species, and Botany. I am currently the President of Georgetown Sustainability Initiative (GSI) and in the Science Honors program at Georgetown College.</description>
