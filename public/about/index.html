          <p>My name is Kaitlyn Brewer. I will be gradutating form Georgetown College with a major in Environmental Science and a minor in Computer Science in May of 2021, with plans of attending gradutae school later. <em>I am still trying to figure out for what and where.</em> My academic interests are Ecological Succession, Invasive and Endangered Species, and Botany.
I am currently the President of Georgetown Sustainability Initiative (GSI) and in the Science Honors program at Georgetown College.</p>
<p>My interest in computer science and coding came after my academic advisor suggested that I try the introductory class, which I loved. I never saw myself in this sort of field, but I really enjoy it and it complements aspects of my major as well.</p>
<p>Please take a look at my articles, some of which are about my personal projects.</p>
<p>This website is still a work in progress. Eventually, I would like to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a specific page to view a list of projects</li>
<li>Potential for viewers to comment on projects</li>
</ul>
